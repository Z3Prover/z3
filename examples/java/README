Examples using the Z3 Java bindings:

1. JavaExample.java - Basic Z3 usage examples covering various features
2. JavaGenericExample.java - Examples using Java generics with Z3
3. SolverIntrospectionExample.java - Demonstrates solver introspection APIs:
   - getUnits(): Retrieve currently inferred unit literals
   - getNonUnits(): Retrieve non-unit atomic formulas
   - getTrail(): Retrieve the solver decision trail

To build the examples, configure Z3 with the --java option to scripts/mk_make.py, build via  
   make examples
in the build directory.

This will create .class files in the build directory, which can be run on Windows via 
   java -cp com.microsoft.z3.jar;. JavaExample

On Linux and FreeBSD, we must use
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. java -cp com.microsoft.z3.jar:. JavaExample
On macOS, the corresponding option is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=. java -cp com.microsoft.z3.jar:. JavaExample  

By default, Z3 Java bindings are automatically loading the required native library for Z3 from the default library path.
In certain environments, depending on the developing process, the Z3 library is not available in the given library path.
To disable the automated loading process, the user can set the environment variable "z3.skipLibraryLoad=true".
In that case, the calling application should directly load the corresponding libraries before any interaction with Z3.
