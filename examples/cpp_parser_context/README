Example demonstrating Z3_parser_context for incremental SMTLIB2 parsing.

To build the example using the Python build system, execute:
   make examples
in the build directory.

This will create the executable cpp_parser_context_example.

To build using CMake, from the examples/cpp_parser_context directory:
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DZ3_DIR=<path-to-z3-build> ..
   make

On Windows, you can just execute the binary.
On macOS and Linux, you must install z3 first using
   sudo make install
OR update LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (macOS) with the build directory to find the Z3 shared library.
