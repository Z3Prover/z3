Small example using the C bindings.
To build the example execute
   make examples
in the build directory.

This command will create the executable c_example.
On Windows, you can just execute it.
On OSX and Linux, you must install z3 first using 
   sudo make install
OR update LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (OSX) with the build directory. You need that to be able to find the Z3 shared library.
