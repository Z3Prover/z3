Small example using the c++ bindings.
To build the example execute
   make examples
in the build directory.

This command will create the executable maxsat.
On Windows, you can just execute it.
On OSX and Linux, you must install z3 first using 
   sudo make install
OR update LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (OSX) with the build directory. You need that to be able to find the Z3 shared library.

This directory contains a test file (ex.smt) that can be use as input for the maxsat test application.
