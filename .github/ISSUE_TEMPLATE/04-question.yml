        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before asking a question

        For general Z3 usage questions, tutorials, and discussions, please consider using:
        - **[GitHub Discussions](../../discussions)** - Best for open-ended discussions
        - **[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/z3)** - Great for specific coding questions
        - **[Z3 Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/)** - Comprehensive tutorials and documentation

        Use this issue template only for questions that are:
        - Specific to Z3's internal behavior or design decisions
        - Related to undocumented behavior that might be a bug
        - Questions that could lead to documentation improvements
