API documentation
-----------------

To generate the API documentation for the C, C++, .NET, Java, Python, and Go APIs, we must execute

   python mk_api_doc.py

We must have doxygen installed in our system.

The documentation will be stored in the subdirectory './api/html'.
The main file is './api/html/index.html'

To include Go API documentation, use:

   python mk_api_doc.py --go

Note: Go documentation requires Go to be installed (for godoc support).

Code documentation
------------------

To generate documentation for the Z3 code, we must execute

   doxygen z3code.dox

We must also have dot installed in our system.

The documentation will be store in the subdirectory './code/html'.
The main file is './code/html/index.html'
