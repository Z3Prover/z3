# Julia Bindings Fix Validation

## Problem
The original issue was that when building Julia bindings on Windows with MSVC, users would get cryptic linker errors like:

```
z3jl.cpp.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "__declspec(dllimport) struct jlcxx::CachedDatatype & __cdecl jlcxx::jlcxx_type(class std::type_index)"
...
..\..\..\z3jl.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 22 unresolved externals
```

This happened because:
1. Julia's CxxWrap provides MinGW import libraries (.dll.a files)
2. MSVC cannot link against MinGW import libraries (needs .lib files)
3. No clear error message was provided to users

## Solution Implemented
Added detection logic in `src/api/julia/CMakeLists.txt` that:
1. Detects when MSVC is being used on Windows
2. Checks if the JlCxx library is a MinGW import library (.dll.a)
3. Provides a clear error message with actionable solutions

## How the Fix Works
When `find_package(JlCxx REQUIRED)` finds a MinGW library but MSVC is being used, the build will now fail early with a helpful message:

```
Julia bindings build error: Incompatible CxxWrap library format detected.
The found libcxxwrap_julia library (/path/to/libcxxwrap_julia.dll.a) is a MinGW import library (.dll.a), 
but Z3 is being built with MSVC which requires .lib format.

Solutions:
1. Use MinGW/GCC instead of MSVC to build Z3
2. Install a MSVC-compatible version of CxxWrap
3. Disable Julia bindings with -DZ3_BUILD_JULIA_BINDINGS=OFF

```

## Validation
- ✅ Build system works correctly on Linux/GCC (no impact)
- ✅ CMake build completes successfully 
- ✅ All Z3 tests pass
- ✅ Basic Z3 functionality validated
- ✅ Julia bindings are correctly not built when not available
- ✅ Detection logic only triggers on Windows + MSVC combination

The fix provides a much better user experience by catching the incompatibility early and providing clear guidance.
