  * Use the CMake build system instead of upstream's custom Python build
    scripts.

  * Update patches:
    - Drop 00-avoid-ocamlopt.patch (no longer needed since we removed
      OCaml support).

      + 01-intrinsics.patch -> 00-intrinsics.patch
      + 05-reproducibility.patch -> 01-reproducibility.patch
      + 04-soname.patch -> 02-soname.patch

  * Build Java bindings on riscv64.
  * Upgrade watch file to version 4 format (no changes).
  * Drop Michael Tautschnig <mt@debian.org> from Uploaders (he hasn't done
    an upload for this package in over four years and never responded to
    any of my emails to him).
