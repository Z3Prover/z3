Module Name:

    propagate_ineqs_tactic.h

Abstract:

    This tactic performs the following tasks:

     - Propagate bounds using the bound_propagator.
     - Eliminate subsumed inequalities.  
       For example:
          x - y >= 3
          can be replaced with true if we know that
          x >= 3 and y <= 0
            
     - Convert inequalities of the form p <= k and p >= k into p = k,
       where p is a polynomial and k is a constant.

    This strategy assumes the input is in arith LHS mode.
    This can be achieved by using option :arith-lhs true in the
    simplifier.
