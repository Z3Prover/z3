Module Name:

    fix_dl_var_tactic.h

Abstract:

    Fix a difference logic variable to 0.
    If the problem is in the difference logic fragment, that is, all arithmetic terms
    are of the form (x + k), and the arithmetic atoms are of the 
    form x - y <= k or x - y = k. Then, we can set one variable to 0.

    This is useful because, many bounds can be exposed after this operation is performed.
