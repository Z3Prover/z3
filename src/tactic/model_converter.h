Notes:

    A model converter, mc, can be used to convert a model for one 
    of a generated subgoal into a model for an initial goal or solver state.
    For a goal or solver state that is decided, a model converter can be
    a simple wrapper around a model.

    Logically, given a formula F and subgoal formula F_s a model converter mc
    for F_s relative to F has the property:

        m |= F_s  iff mc(m) |= F     for every model m

    For the evaluator associated with models, m, we expect

        eval(m)(F_s) <=> eval(mc(m))(F)

    This property holds for both eval, that decides on a fixed value
    for constants that have no interpretation in m and for 'peval' 
    (partial eval) that returns just the constants that are unfixed.
    (in the model evaluator one can control this behavior using a 
    configuration flag)

    and more generally over the eval method have:

        G => F_s   iff peval(mc(e))(G) => F   for every formula G

    
    where e is the empty model (a model that does not evaluate any

    When a model converter supports application to a formula it satisfies
    the following property:

       mc(G) & F_s is SAT  iff G & F is SAT

    For a model converter that is a sequence of definitions and removals
    of functions we can obtain mc(G) by adding back or expanding definitions
    that are required to interpret G fully in the context of F_s.
